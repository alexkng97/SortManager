# Sort Manager

A program that generates a random array and will sort it using a specified sorting algorithm.

Users will be able to select an algorithm of their choice and enter the size of the random array they want generated.


Sorting Algorithms implemented:
1. Binary Tree Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Selection Sort

Users can clone this repository and run the class file based on what program they want:

To run the GUI, users should run GUIRunner. 

To run the command line program, users should run CommandLineRunner.

GUI was implemented using Java 8, so users may have to revert to an older version of Java SDK in order for it to work properly.
